    "script": "In this Pricing and Cost Analysis Report, we explore the financial structure of our educational platform, focusing on three pricing tiers: Free, Basic, and Premium. The Free tier has the highest user distribution with 75% of students, while Basic and Premium tiers account for 17% and 8%, respectively. \n\nWe analyze costs associated with features like text chat, speech-to-text, text-to-speech, and video avatars. The monthly operating cost totals $492, with significant expenses coming from voice processing and video generation. Notably, the video component is the most expensive, but optimization strategies help reduce costs significantly.\n\nThe cost per student varies by plan, with the Free tier costing just $0.008 per user per month and the Premium tier at $0.680. Overall, the monthly revenue stands at $4,550, resulting in a net profit of $4,058 and an impressive profit margin of 89%.\n\nThis analysis underscores the importance of balancing feature offerings with cost management. As we move forward, how can we optimize our offerings further while maintaining accessibility for all students?",
